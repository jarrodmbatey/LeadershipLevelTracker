"Create a web application for a Field Leadership Assessment Tool based on John Maxwell’s 5 Levels of Leadership. The app will allow both a leader and their manager to complete an assessment and automatically generate a gap analysis, final leadership score, and improvement recommendations.
Core Features
1. User Authentication
•	Use Firebase Authentication (email & password login)
•	Three user roles: Administrator, Leader and Manager
•	Secure database to store responses
2. Assessment Form
•	40 questions divided into 3 leadership categories:
o	Positional Leadership (Authority, Responsibility)
o	Permission Leadership (Trust, Relationships)
o	Production Leadership (Results, Accountability)
Section 1: Positional Leadership (Title-Based Leadership)
Assessing authority, clarity, and responsibility in leadership role
These questions evaluate how effectively a leader establishes authority and operates within their role. Leadership based on position alone is the lowest level of leadership (Maxwell, 2011), and it must be strengthened through relationships and results.
11.	I clearly understand my responsibilities as a leader. (Maxwell emphasizes that clarity in responsibility builds credibility.)
12.	I consistently communicate expectations to my team. (Kotter, 1996, notes that strong leaders articulate vision and direction.)
13.	My team follows my directions because of my position. (A leader who relies solely on position lacks influence.)
14.	I make decisions confidently within my role’s authority. (Goleman, 1998, identifies decisiveness as a key leadership trait.)
15.	I enforce company policies fairly and consistently. (Fairness strengthens legitimacy and respect.)
16.	I take responsibility for both successes and failures in my team. (Accountability fosters trust and reliability.)
17.	My team respects my authority as their leader. (Respect must be earned beyond just a title.)
18.	I am proactive in solving problems rather than waiting for direction. (Leaders must anticipate and act.)
19.	I stay updated on policies, procedures, and industry trends relevant to my role. (Learning is key to sustained leadership success.)
20.	I demonstrate professionalism and set the tone for workplace culture. (A leader’s behavior shapes the team’s norms.)

Section 2: Permission Leadership (Relationship-Based Leadership)
Assessing trust, communication, and team engagement
Maxwell’s second level of leadership emphasizes that people follow leaders because they want to, not because they have to (Maxwell, 2011). This section evaluates a leader’s ability to connect with and inspire their team.
21.	I build strong relationships with my team members. (Trust is foundational to leadership influence.)
22.	I actively listen to my team’s concerns and feedback. (Covey, 1989, stresses that “seek first to understand” is a crucial habit.)
23.	My team feels comfortable approaching me with problems. (Approachability fosters an open culture.)
24.	I show appreciation for my team’s efforts and contributions. (Recognition increases engagement.)
25.	I am approachable and open to different perspectives. (Inclusive leadership strengthens decision-making.)
26.	I foster an environment of mutual trust and respect. (Psychological safety improves team performance.)
27.	I mentor and coach my team members for professional growth. (Maxwell notes that great leaders develop other leaders.)
28.	I make an effort to understand the personal motivations of my team. (Understanding individual drivers enhances engagement.)
29.	I resolve conflicts fairly and constructively. (Conflict resolution maintains team cohesion.)
30.	I support work-life balance and employee well-being. (Healthy teams sustain long-term success.)

Section 3: Production Leadership (Results-Oriented Leadership)
Assessing effectiveness in achieving results, driving performance, and leading by example
Maxwell’s third level of leadership is where leaders are judged by what they achieve (Maxwell, 2011). At this stage, leaders must produce results, inspire performance, and lead by example.

42.	My team consistently meets or exceeds performance expectations. (High-performing teams reflect strong leadership.)
43.	I lead by example through my own productivity and work ethic. (Actions speak louder than words.)
44.	I hold my team accountable for results. (Accountability drives performance.)
45.	I recognize and reward high performance. (Recognition reinforces positive behavior.)
46.	I effectively delegate tasks to optimize team performance. (Delegation maximizes efficiency.)
47.	I make data-driven decisions to improve performance. (Informed decisions reduce risk.)
48.	I encourage continuous improvement and innovation. (Growth mindset fosters adaptability.)
49.	I address underperformance quickly and effectively. (Timely interventions maintain high standards.)
50.	My team understands how their work contributes to organizational success. (Purpose drives motivation.)
51.	I provide constructive feedback to help my team grow. (Feedback is essential for improvement.)
52.	I adapt leadership strategies based on team needs. (Situational awareness enhances leadership effectiveness.)
53.	I create an environment that motivates people to give their best effort. (Leaders inspire performance.)

59.	I demonstrate resilience in challenging situations. (Leaders must remain steady in adversity.)
60.	I continuously seek personal development and leadership growth. (Great leaders are lifelong learners.)
•	
•	Each question is rated on a 1-5 scale
•	The leader and the manager complete separate assessments
3. Scoring & Gap Analysis
•	Calculate:
o	The leader and their supervisor independently rate leadership competencies on a 1-5 scale:
1 - Strongly Disagree
2 - Disagree
3 - Neutral
4 - Agree
5 - Strongly Agree
•	
o	Self-Score (Leader’s responses average)
o	Manager Score (Manager’s responses average)
o	Final Leadership Score = (Self-Score + Manager Score) ÷ 2
•	Gap Analysis Calculation:
o	Identify questions with a 2+ point gap between leader & manager
o	Highlight leadership category (Positional, Permission, Production) with most gaps
o	Display biggest improvement areas
4. Results Dashboard & Visualization
•	Display scores using Chart.js (Radar Chart for category performance)
•	Show gap analysis table (highlighting questions with gaps)
•	Provide AI-generated improvement suggestions
